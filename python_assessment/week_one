Create a simple Python program that asks the user 
to input two numbers and a mathematical operation 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input
and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, 
your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.


def arithmeticOperations(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    print(f'the sum of {a} + {b} = {sum}')
    subtract = a - b
    print(f'the sub of {a} - {b} = {subtract}')
    mult = a * b
    print(f'the multiplication of {a} x {b} = {mult}')
    division = a/b
    print(f'the division of {a} + {b} = {division}')
a=int(input("enter number a:"))
b=int(input("enter number b:"))

print(arithmeticOperations(a,b))
