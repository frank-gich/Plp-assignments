Create a simple Python program that asks the user 
to input two numbers and a mathematical operation 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input
and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, 
your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.

fun arithmeticOperations(a, b):
   a = input('enter number a')
   b = input('enter number b')

     sum = a + b
      print(sum)
     sub = a - b
      print(sub)
    mult = a * b
      print(mult)
